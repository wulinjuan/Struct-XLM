# Summary

This is the Polish portion of the Parallel Universal Dependencies (PUD) treebanks, created at the Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.Re


# Introduction

PUD-PL consists of 1000 Polish sentences (18,389 tokens) in the same order as in the PUD treebanks in other languages. Morpho-syntactic annotations were automatically predicted by [COMBO](https://github.com/360er0/COMBO) trained on Polish Dependency Bank 2.0 and then manually corrected. Finally, the trees were converted into the UD trees using the same converting procedure as in the case of the PDB-UD treebank. The annotation schema of PUD-PL is thus the same as in the Polish PDB-UD treebank. 459 PUD-PL trees contain enhanced edges.

# Acknowledgments

The development of the PDB-UD treebank was founded by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education as part of the investment in the CLARIN-PL research infrastructure.
