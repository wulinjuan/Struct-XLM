# Summary

This treebank is a translation of English ATIS (Airline Travel Information System) corpus (see References). It consists of 5432 sentences.


# Introduction

After a machine translation process, faulty sentences were corrected by experts. All dependency relations were manually annotated. The data is split into three sets as 4274 training, 572 development, and 586 test items. The corpus mainly consists of questions/requests regarding travel information, particularly focused on aviation.
